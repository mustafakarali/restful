RESTful API (sample)
This is an example code. A fraction of a real code I developed but all confidential data has been removed.

The htaccess will redirect all requests to API.php
API.php is the starting point.
The request class will take the request and recognize the endpoints.
Each endpoint should have a controller otherwise an error will shown.
The endpoint controllers should deal with the requests. (Actual working functions has been removed)
All response from API (result or error) must come back as json file.
